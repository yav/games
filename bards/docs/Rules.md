Bards
 -----


Structure of a Turn
===================

  1. Remove fan tokens from your previous turn.
  2. Choose a bard for this turn, removing their mask, if any.
  3. If the bard was on the board, then move them. 
     If the active bard is not yet on the board, place it on a region.
  4. Take the action associated with the location of the active bard.

You may add/spend additional tokens (fans, masks, provisions) at any time during your turn.
A new bard may start off masked, as long you have a mask for them.


The Regions
===========

**The Pub**  *You made a friend!*
Take a 1/1 bard from the supply.  You may place it on a later turn.

**The Stables**  *It’s time for a new horse.*
Spend 1 provision token and replace the bard with another one that has the same popularity,
but is faster (1 -> 2, 2 -> 4).

**The Conservatory**  *You are going to form a band!*
Remove any number of bards that are not captivated, and replace the currently
active bard with a new token from the supply.  The values on the new
token are limited by the values of the removed tokens, including the active
bard:

  * popularity: **sum** of the removed popularities, and
  * speed:     **slowest** of the removed speeds.

**The Campgrounds** *You take a refreshing break.*
Take another turn, but there's no need to remove fans or masks.

**The Crossroads**  *Close enough.*
Use the action of one of the orthogonally adjacent regions.

**The Market**
Place a cube (fan, mask, or provision) on the market, then:
  1. either take two cubes from the ones on the market, or
  2. take a cube from the bank.

**The Town Square**  *It is nice to have fans.*
Gain a fan token.  Fans may be used on future turns to increase a
bard’s popularity by 1 for a turn.  Multiple fans may be used on the same bard.
If you used fans to captivate a more (or equally) popular bard dance,
you have a few options:

  1. add new fans to keep the other bard captivated, or
  2. add a mask to your bard and share the space with the other bard,
  3. activate the bard and move them away, or
  4. your bard is captivated and goes to the bottom of the pile.

**The Grocer**  *A bard ahs to eat.*
Gain a provision.   provisions may be discarded to increase a bard’s movement by 2.
Multiple provisions may be discarded to further increase the movement.

**Masquerade**  *Sometimes it's better to go incognito.*
Gain a mask.  Masks may be assigned to bards on future turns.  Masked bards
exert influence as usual, but they cannot be captivated by, or captivate other bards.
A masked bard may enter a location, disregarding the influence of other bards.
Bards stay masked until they are activated again.

**The Arena**   *Time for a performance!*

A saga has 3 parts, and each part may be **about* or **against** something.
   1. Choose what kind of parts your saga will have
   2. For each part, roll a die to pick a topic (1,2: fan; 3,4: mask; 5,6: food)
      * If the given part is about the topic, then to complete the saga you need to spend the given
