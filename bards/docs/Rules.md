Bards


**Structure of a Turn**

  1. Remove fans---they have done their job, they are tired now.
  2. Choose a bard for this turn, removing his/her mask, if any.
  3. Optionally, allocates masks and fans.
  4. Move the active bard, spending maps if desired.
  5. Take the action of the regions where you stop.



The Regions
-----------

**The Pub**  *You made a friend!*
Take a 1/1 bard from the supply and place it under the activating token.

**The Stables**  *It’s time for a new horse.*
Replace the bard with another one that has the same popularity,
but is faster (1 -> 2, 2 -> 4).

**The Conservatory**  *You are going to form a band!*
Remove any number of bards that are not dancing, and replace the currently
active bard with a new token from the supply.  The values on the new
token are limited by the values of the removed tokens, including the active
bard:

  * popularity: **sum** of the removed popularities, and
  * speed:     **slowest** of the removed speeds.

**Encore** *That was a great show!*
Take another turn, but there's no need to remove fans or masks.

**XXX: This is a bit weak: it just allows you to go through this place a
bit faster.  Perhaps that's OK, and there should be multiple spaces like that?
Thus speed would depend on both your horse and the terrain?**

**Merchant**  *This guy has connections.*
Use the action of one of the orthogonally adjacent regions.

**Fan Club**  *It is nice to have fans.*
Gain a fan token.  Fans may be used on future turns to increase a
bard’s popularity by 1 for a turn.  Multiple fans may be used on the same bard.
If you used fans to make a more (or equally) popular bard dance,
you have a few options:

  1. add new fans to keep the other bard dancing, or
  2. add a mask to your bard and share the space with the other bard,
  3. activate the bard and move him/her away, or
  4. your bard starts dancing and goes to the bottom of the pile.

**XXX?** You may also use fans to cause currently 


**The Map Shop**  *You learn a  handy short-cut.*
Gain a map.   Maps may be discarded to increase a bard’s movement by 2.
Multiple maps may be discarded to further increase the movement.

**Masquerade**  *Sometimes it's better to go incognito.*
Gain a mask.  Masks may be assigned to bards on future turns.  Masked bards
exert influence as usual, but they cannot dance or make others dance---if
they end up in the same region as another bard they share the space.  Bards
stay masked until they are activated again.
